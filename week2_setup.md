# Week 2 Assessments - Team Purple

## Setup

This section documents Team Purple's work for week 2 of the Software Engineering module. The primary goals were:

1. The correct setup of Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as our primary development environment.
2. Ensuring proper integration of GitHub for version control.
3. Creation and cloning of our main repository for the module.

## Environment Configuration

For Team Purple's project, integrating Visual Studio Code with GitHub is crucial. This seamless integration will ensure that code changes are tracked efficiently, and collaboration is smooth.

### Screenshots with Commentary

**Caption 2:** Here we have Team Purple's main repository on GitHub. The 'README.md' and '.gitignore' files have been set up. This repository is the heart of our project where all collaborative code will reside.

**Caption 3:** Demonstrating the process of cloning our GitHub repository directly into VSCode. By doing so, each team member can work locally and then push changes back to the main repository.

### **Key Points to Note**

- Images have been organized in the `images` directory for clarity.
- The commentary isn't just a recap of what's visible in the screenshots but provides context and understanding of our setup decisions.

## Reflection

### Strengths of Our Setup

The integration of VSCode with GitHub streamlines our workflow. With the ability to directly interact with GitHub from VSCode, our team can handle issues, pull requests, and code reviews more efficiently. This setup positions Team Purple for a more collaborative and error-free coding experience.

### Considering Alternatives

While VSCode is our primary choice due to its powerful features and extensions, alternatives like JetBrains IntelliJ or Atom could have been considered. They too offer robust GitHub integrations. However, given the team's familiarity and comfort with VSCode, it was a unanimous choice.

### Setup Challenges

The only hiccup we encountered was ensuring everyone had the same extensions and settings in VSCode to maintain code consistency. We overcame this by sharing a list of required extensions and a settings file, ensuring a uniform development environment for all members.
